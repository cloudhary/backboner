# Backboner

Have you ever felt like your back hurts after working on a coding assignment for too long? Afraid that you might injure yourself doing deadlifts because of bad posture? 

Think Fitbit, but for your back. Go through your day wearing the brace and rest assured that we've got your back!

## How does it work?
The brace is equipped with 6 flex sensors and 2 IMUs and measures your posture on a regular interval of 6 seconds. Information is logged by the Particle Photon board that then gets sent to the web app for the user to view.

## Why this?
Bad posture plagues our modern world. People are rarely watching for their posture as they go about their daily activities, but many complain later in their lives of the pain that results. What does it mean to be doing that?
